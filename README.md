# üßæ Mintscan to Koinly Converter

This Python script transforms a transaction history CSV file downloaded from [Mintscan](https://www.mintscan.io) into a **Koinly-compatible Advanced CSV format**, ready to be imported directly into [Koinly](https://koinly.io) for tax reporting.

---

## ‚úÖ What the script does

- Filters only the **relevant transaction types**: `Send`, `Receive`, `IBCSend`, `IBCReceive`, and `GetReward`.
- Automatically **normalizes IBC types** (`IBCSend` ‚Üí `Send`, `IBCReceive` ‚Üí `Receive`).
- **Groups** transactions by their `txhash` to consolidate related actions.
- **Converts timestamps** to the required Koinly format (`YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`, UTC).
- **Labels `GetReward` transactions** with the `reward` tag for correct classification in Koinly.
- Outputs a CSV file named like the original but with `_transformed.csv` appended ‚Äî ready for import into Koinly.
